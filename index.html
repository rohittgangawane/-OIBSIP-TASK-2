  <p><u><b>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</u></b> (2 October 1869 - 30 January 1948), popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi, was an Indian revolutionary, 
    anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's 
    independence from British rule and later inspire movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific epithet 
    Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world. 
    <br>Gandhi changed the world in many ways. One way was he won over India's independence from the British. Gandhi won independence for 
    India by using his non-violent methods. He showed the world that using violence was wrong. India loves Gandhi for giving
    them their freedom and independence. One more thing that Gandhi did was tell everyone to stand up for their own rights and to also
    to fight against cruelty. Later on Martin Luther King Jr. used Gandhi's non-violent methods and he won civil rights
    for African Americans. Using non-violence may be the best way to fight! </p>
